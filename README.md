Behold the Magic 8 Ball! It sees all, it knows all!
I am a code newbie, I signed up for a workshop that requires basic javascript skills and as such have been learning it through Codecademy this week. This is where I'll add the little projects I do to practice the skills I learn as the course progresses.
Also, I'm new to Git and GitHub (I HAVE NO IDEA HOW THEY WORK or what I'm doing) but learning #funtimes.
